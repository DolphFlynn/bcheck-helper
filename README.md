# BCheck Helper
This extension provides a quick way to view and download BChecks in any given GitHub repository. 
By default, this is `portswigger/bchecks`, which you can find [here](https://github.com/portswigger/bchecks).

Using this extension, you can also copy the contents of the BCheck so that you can import them using the BCheck editor,
and you can save them to a directory on your machine.

If you'd like to find out more about BChecks, you can view our documentation [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/automated-scanning/bchecks).
